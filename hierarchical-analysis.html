        <h3>What are spreading dynamics?</h3>
        <p>
            Many real-world systems have been modeled as networks. One of the key aspects of understanding the behavior of such systems is to model the spreading dynamics on these networks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here, we present a hierarchical analysis of spreading dynamics on spatial networks. We use a multiscale framework to approximate spreading dynamics across different spatial scales under certain simplifying assumptions. We apply this framework to the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to analyze the effects of perturbations and to identify critical regions and connections that disproportionately influence system dynamics. We find that the hierarchical analysis is able to capture the spreading dynamics across different spatial scales, and is able to identify critical regions and connections that disproportionately influence system dynamics.

        <h3>Similarities between traffic congestion & COVID-19 spreading</h3>
        <p>
            Traffic congestion and COVID-19 spreading are both examples of spreading dynamics on spatial networks. In both cases, the spreading dynamics are influenced by the spatial distribution of the population, and the spatial distribution of the population is influenced by the spreading dynamics.
        </p>

        <h3>Constructing the network</h3>
        <p>
            The network is constructed from the spatial distribution of the population. The spatial distribution of the population is influenced by the spreading dynamics.

        <h3>Hierarchical Model</h3>
        <p>
            The hierarchical model is a model that is able to capture the spreading dynamics across different spatial scales. The hierarchical model is able to capture the spreading dynamics across different spatial scales by using a multiscale framework.
        </p>

        <h3>What Next?</h3>
        <p>
            The simplicity of such models such as the SIR model allows for a higher degree of analytical interpretability, and thus with the development of more actionable strategies. We hope this work promotes strengthening and further development of such existing simple models in a more computationally efficient manner.
