            Many real-world systems have been modeled as networks. One of the key aspects of understanding the behavior of such systems is to model the spreading dynamics on these networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, we present a hierarchical analysis of spreading dynamics on spatial networks. We use a multiscale framework to approximate spreading dynamics across different spatial scales under certain simplifying assumptions. We apply this framework to the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to analyze the effects of perturbations and to identify critical regions and connections that disproportionately influence system dynamics. We find that the hierarchical analysis is able to capture the spreading dynamics across different spatial scales, and is able to identify critical regions and connections that disproportionately influence system dynamics.

            The simplicity of such models such as the SIR model allows for a higher degree of analytical interpretability, and thus with the development of more actionable strategies. We hope this work promotes strengthening and further development of such existing simple models in a more computationally efficient manner.
